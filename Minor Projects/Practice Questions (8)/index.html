        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Learning to build websites is not only a valuable and exciting skill—it’s also incredibly empowering. With the ability to write your own code, you can bring your creative ideas to life and share them with the world. Whether it's a portfolio, a personal blog, or a professional website, HTML and CSS are the essential tools that set the foundation.</p>

        <p>When I first started learning web development, I was amazed at how a few simple lines of code could build the structure of an entire page. It felt like unlocking a new language—one that lets you speak directly to the browser and control what users see.</p>

        <h3>Why HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the skeleton of every web page. It's the language that defines the structure of your content—like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Without HTML, there’s no foundation to style or interact with.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It's the first step in web development.</li>
          <li>Works alongside CSS and JavaScript seamlessly.</li>
          <li>Helps you understand how web content is organized.</li>
          <li>Plays a crucial role in accessibility and SEO.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>HTML is easy to get started with, yet deep enough that you can continue learning new best practices for years. Whether you’re a hobbyist or a future professional developer, mastering HTML is your first milestone.</p>

        <h3>What About CSS?</h3>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) gives your HTML structure life and color. It allows you to style text, space out elements, add borders, shadows, and transitions—and much more. CSS is what turns a raw structure into a beautiful experience for the user.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Style text with colors, fonts, and sizes.</li>
          <li>Design page layouts using grid and flexbox.</li>
          <li>Create hover effects, animations, and responsiveness.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>One of the first things I loved about CSS was how quickly you could see changes. Adjusting a color or font and watching the page update in real time gave me a sense of creative control that was really fun and rewarding.</p>

        <h3>A Glimpse of a Web Page</h3>
        <p>Below is an example layout. It might look simple now, but even professional websites often start with a clean and well-structured foundation. The best designs usually come from clear, readable code that’s easy to manage and expand upon.</p>

 

        <p>Remember, your first webpage doesn’t need to be perfect. Start small. Build a page with your favorite quotes or a hobby blog. The more you practice, the better you get. Over time, you’ll learn to use more advanced CSS features like media queries, transitions, and custom variables.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Getting started with web development is easier than most people think. You don’t need expensive software or years of experience. Just a text editor, a browser, and a willingness to experiment.</p>

        <p>Start by building a simple page. Add a heading, a paragraph, maybe an image. Then try styling it with some CSS. Bit by bit, you’ll learn how each element works and how you can combine them to make something powerful.</p>

        <p>In the next few weeks, I’ll be sharing tutorials on flexbox layouts, responsive design, and building your first navigation menu. Stay tuned—and happy coding!</p>
